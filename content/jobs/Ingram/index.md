- Migrated the IMOnline App from UIkit to SwiftUI and have redesigned the app by improving the UI/UX and also have followed MVVM and Clean Architecture to improve the code for the same. We were able to reduce the inline memory consumption by 50% and  screen loading time to 3 seconds.

- Integrated Okta Authentication, Adobe AEP Analytics & Crashlytics into the new IMOnline app for application security and to help the organisation understand the client interaction with the application.

- Followed Agile Software Development Practices including weekly iterations and retrospectives.

- I was also rewarded as the **Rookie Of The Year**

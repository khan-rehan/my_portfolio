Hello! My name is Rehan and I love to explore new technologies and leverage them to solve real-life problems. I like to create things and I've found programming to be one of the most affordable ways.

Interestingly, I got introduced to programming in my freshman year at 
[University Of Mumbai](https://mu.ac.in/) where I completed my Bachelor of Engineering in Information Technology(2017-2021) with distinction.

I'm currently working as an iOS Developer at **Ingram Micro**. My responsibilties include developing high-end iOS applications, identifying and fixing application bottlenecks, maintaining the core code and also write test cases.
 

Here is a list of the technologies that I'm familiar with!
